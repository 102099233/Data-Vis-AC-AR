          <h2>Energy Usage by Industry between 1990 and 2020</h2>
          <p id = "line"></p>
          <p>Figure 1.</p>
          <p>To interact with this chart, hover over the line to see what industry that line is portraying. This graph is showing<br>
            the trends in energy consumption from 1990 to 2020 by different industries in Australia. The y-axis is in petajoules. <br>
            Certain industries are consistent in their energy usage such as residential which has not changed much over the years. <br>
            However, mining and transport have had large increases especially in the last decade. </p>
          <br>

					<h2>Total energy consumed in each state by industry</h2>
					<p id ="stacked"></p>
					<p>Figure 2.</p>
					<p>As shown in Figure 2. NSW, Vic, Qld, and WA are the largest energy consuming states in Australia.<br>
					Figure 2. also shows that NSW and VIC consume the largest amount of energy in the residential industry, this could be<br>
					due to NSW and VIC having the largest populations in Australia. Furthermore, WA and QLD consume the most energy in<br>
					the mining industry which would be due to WA and QLD being the most resource rich states in Australia.</p>
