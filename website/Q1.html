          <p>Figure 1.</p>
          <p>The Figure 1 visualisation shows a map of Australia split into its different states. To interact with it, hover the mouse over the state you would</br>
            like information to display to view the data. The data shown in the pop up box is the total energy produced through the two different fuel types.</br>
            This data is most recently from 2019. One being renewable fuels and the second being nonrenewable fuels. The biggest producer of energy</br>
            as a whole is NSW followed by Victoria. An interesting state to consider in the drive for sustainable energy production is Tasmania.</br>
            They are the 3rd largest producer of renewable energy and the smallest producer of non-renewable energy.  Data was not available for ACT. </p>
          <br>

          <h2>Total energy consumed in each state by industry</h2>

          <p>Figure 2.</p>
          <p>To interact with figure 2, click one of the two buttons to toggle between the graph you would like to view. These two graphs breakdown the</br>
            electricity generation between the fuels. As you toggle between the graphs be wary of scaling along the y-axis. These graphs are highlighting the</br>
            trends from 1990 to 2020 of different fuel usage to produce electricity in Australia. As seen in the renewable graph, since 2005 a sharp increase</br>
            has occurred in electricity generation through most renewable fuels. Non-renewable fuels on the other hand have had movement over the given period</br>
            but aren't as sharp in their movement. Interestingly between 2005 and 2010, black coal usage went down by about 20,000 GWh at the same time natural</br>
            gas went up by the same amount. This could indicate that black coal was substituted by natural gas. </p>
